<p>The Linux and Unix Users Group at Virginia Tech has an announcement list,
<code>vtluug-announce</code>, and a discussion list, <code>vtluug</code>. The
announcement list is a low-traffic list primarily used for event announcements,
and the discussion list is a moderate-traffic open forum, with regular traffic
including questions, suggestions, and job postings.</p>

<p>We encourage interested parties to subscribe to just the announcement list
or to both lists as event announcements are not cross-posted to the discussion
list unless someone starts a thread. Meetings are typically posted on the
Announcement list.</p>
