<h3>History and Status</h3>

<p>The Linux and Unix Users Group was founded in 1997. To avoid a name
collision with the Vermont Linux Users Group, the organization chose the name
"Linux/Unix Users' Group". To simplify the punctuation and comply with
Virginia Tech policy regarding student organization names, the slash and
apostrophe were dropped and the school affiliation was moved to the end of the
name. The historical abbreviation of VTLUUG and domain name of
<code>vtluug.org</code> have been kept, as they are not directly addressed by
the relevant policies. Our status with Virginia Polytechnic Institute and
State University is that of an undergraduate, special interest, registered
student organization.</p>

<p>We consider anyone that idles in our IRC channel or is a member of our
listserv to be a member of the VTLUUG. You don't have to attend our weekly
meetings, come to any of our events, or pay membership dues. In fact, you don't
even have to attend Virginia Tech; we welcome anyone interested in Linux and
Unix and have plenty of members that don't even live anywhere near
Blacksburg.</p>
