# vtluug-site
This is the vtluug static site<s>, hosted by github pages.</s>

it is hosted on sczi. you can inspect the configuration of the docker container that is reverse proxied [here](https://github.com/vtluug/docker-manifests/tree/master/sczi/vtluug-site). tldr: it pulls this repo automatically, so updates here are reflected on vtluug.org

vtluug.github.io *also* exists, but is not what is currently hosting vtluug.org.

## Important Note
This site uses a simple custom static site generator found in generator.py. More details
can be found there, but in general the files you should edit are the global css file,
template.html, and the various pages found in the pages folder.

## Old site
The old site is stored in the old/ folder
